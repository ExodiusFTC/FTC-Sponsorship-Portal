# Matchmaker: The Common App for FTC

A "Dynamic Portfolio" and Verified Grant Portal connecting FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) robotics teams with verified corporate sponsors. Teams maintain a professional "Portfolio" (Global Team Data) and generate Customized Submissions with unique, trackable URLs for sponsors. Admins vet the quality of the 'Custom Pitch' fields before dispatching links to sponsors.

## Architecture

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui |
| Database & Auth | Supabase (Postgres + RLS + Auth + Storage) |
| Email Dispatch | Resend + React Email |
| Validation | Zod + React Hook Form |
| Hosting | Vercel + Supabase Cloud |

## Key Design Principles

- **RLS-first authorization** — every table enforces policy at the DB layer; app code is the second line of defense
- **Admin-gatekept dispatch** — no email leaves the platform without admin approval
- **COPPA compliance** — only verified adult coaches register; zero student PII columns in schema
- **Immutable audit log** — all admin actions are appended to `audit_log`
- **Sponsor capacity integrity** — `funding_cap_cents` / `funding_used_cents` enforced at DB level; inactive or fully-funded sponsors are invisible to coaches

## User Roles

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| `coach` | Adult advisor who registers, builds team portfolio, creates submissions |
| `admin` | Platform operator who verifies coaches, reviews submissions, and triggers dispatch. Requires TOTP/MFA (`aal2`) for all admin actions. |
| `sponsor` | Funder account that reviews dispatched submissions and approves/declines funding from `/sponsor/dashboard` |

Sponsors can also be reached without logging in via a unique, trackable link (`/sponsor-view/[token]`) sent by email.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- The [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) and `psql` (for migrations)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project
- A [Resend](https://resend.com) account

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=        # Supabase anon key — use the legacy JWT (eyJ…)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=            # Supabase service_role key — legacy JWT (eyJ…)
RESEND_API_KEY=
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET=                # Svix signing secret; required in production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
CRON_SECRET=                          # bearer token for the Vercel cron; required
# Optional: SENTRY_DSN, NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN, ADMIN_NOTIFICATION_EMAILS
```

> **Use the legacy Supabase JWT keys** (Settings → API → JWT keys, they start with `eyJ`). The new `sb_publishable_…` / `sb_secret_…` format is **not** reliably accepted by the API. There is **no** Upstash/Redis dependency — rate limiting was removed.

### Database Setup

Migrations are idempotent and build the full schema (tables, RLS, storage buckets, enums). Apply them with `supabase db reset --linked` **or** `psql`. A few migrations define multiple `$$`-quoted functions in one file (0035/0041/0044/0047), which the Supabase CLI splitter mishandles — apply those with `psql -f`, which parses dollar-quotes correctly:

```bash
# Apply every migration in order via the session-mode pooler
for f in supabase/migrations/*.sql; do
  psql "postgresql://postgres.<ref>:<password>@<region>.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres" \
    -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f "$f"
done
```

Do **not** run `supabase/seed.sql` against production — it is dev-only test data.

### Running Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

App runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Chunk Roadmap

| Chunk | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Done | Scaffold, auth, DB schema, RLS, Supabase clients, seed |
| 2 | Done | Master Portfolio flow, FTC roster validator, incubator flow |
| 3 | Done | Submission builder with custom pitch alignment |
| 4 | Done | Sponsor database, targeting UI, opt-in application |
| 5 | Done | Admin review queue and Resend dispatch |
| 6 | Done | Analytics/COPPA hardening, E2E tests, dual-channel notifications, launch prep |

## Deployment

Live on Vercel at **https://ftc-sponsorship-portal.vercel.app** (Hobby tier). Runtime env vars are configured in the Vercel project (not committed). The daily cron (`/api/cron/expire-submissions`) is defined in `vercel.json` and authed with `CRON_SECRET`. See `CLAUDE.md` → "Deployment & Ops" for the Supabase-key and migration gotchas.
